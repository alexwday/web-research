### Scholarly frames applied to Fallout

Simulacra and nostalgia studies. Kathleen McClancy mobilizes Jean Baudrillard's simulacra to argue that Fallout constructs a "hyperreal" retro‑future whose images both "overtly mock Cold War nostalgia" and yet "position[] itself as outside of that nostalgia"—thereby reproducing Cold War ideology even as it satirizes it [1]. Here, simulacra (copies without an original; a collapse of signifier and signified) is used to read Fallout's pervasive mid‑century iconography as culturally productive, not merely decorative [1].

Pastiche, parody, and satire theory. Scholars treat Fallout's aesthetic as retrofuturist pastiche (recycling 1950s futurisms) that can function either as affectionate kitsch or as sharp parody. McClancy cites debates that place retrofuturism between "mocked and yearned for" futures [1], while Marissa Schuling reads the series' curated in‑world displays as museum‑like exhibits that purposefully critique American Exceptionalism through teleological storytelling in game spaces (e.g., case studies such as the Museum of Freedom and Vault‑Tec exhibits) [3].

Ludonarrative and econarratology. Game‑studies scholars bring gameplay systems into the theoretical mix. McClancy argues that game rules (mechanics) can undermine retrofuturist simulacra by forcing players to act within resource scarcity and moral tradeoffs, offering "a possible way out of the mirror‑maze of simulation" [1]. Joseph Boisvere develops an econarratological approach—linking environment, play, and subjectivity—using Fallout 4's open world, faction systems, and hundreds of gameplay hours to show how environment and mechanics co‑produce meaning [2].

Media archaeology and material culture. Both Schuling and McClancy rely on close readings of in‑game artefacts (posters, Pip‑Boy UI, museum exhibits) to show how midcentury design choices carry ideological freight; Schuling explicitly frames Fallout as a "museum" that stages teleological narratives of American progress to be interrogated by players [3].

#### Key debates and divergences

- Critique versus reproduction: Is Fallout primarily satirical (undermining Cold War myths) or complicit in commodifying 1950s nostalgia? McClancy presents this as an ambivalent outcome: satire that simultaneously reinscribes the simulacrum [1]. Schuling emphasizes pedagogic critique via curated exhibits, arguing for a mostly critical reading [3]. Boisvere foregrounds how players' embodied engagement with mechanics mediates these readings, complicating blanket claims about authorial intent [2].

- Image versus rule: Scholars disagree on whether aesthetics (images, music, kitsch) or ludic systems are the primary site of critique. McClancy proposes an interplay; Boisvere and other ludonarrative scholars call for more systematic analyses of mechanics as ideological devices [1][2].

#### Gaps and opportunities

Existing literature robustly maps aesthetics, nostalgia theory, and simulacra, but gaps remain: longitudinal reception studies across demographics; systematic media‑archaeological work tying developer production choices to ideological outcomes; and comparative ludo‑narrative metrics (e.g., quantifying how often mechanics force scarcity‑based choices across playthroughs). Addressing these would clarify when Fallout critiques versus reproduces 1950s Americana.
