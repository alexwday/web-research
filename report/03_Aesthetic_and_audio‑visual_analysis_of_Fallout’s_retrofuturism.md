### Definition: retrofuturism (as used here)
Retro‑futurism: an aesthetic that combines historical visual language (here, 1940s–1950s American mass culture) with imagined future technologies; in Fallout this appears as “Atomic Age” product design, chrome robots, and analog UI skeuomorphism. The term grounds the following artifact analysis.

### Visual motifs: architecture, appliances, products
Recurring visual tokens instantiate 1950s Americana: chrome diner counters and Formica surfaces (seen repeatedly in Fallout 3’s Rivet City and Fallout 4’s diners), streamline Moderne signage, and neon hourglass logos on beverage posters (Nuka‑Cola). Product design emphasizes rounded plastic/metal, fins, and exaggerated gauges (RobCo terminals, vacuum‑tube‑style Pip‑Boy UI). Robots (Mr. Handy) reuse Googie/household appliance silhouettes—domesticity turned automaton—so the “home” aesthetic becomes uncanny in ruined environments.

#### Typography and graphic design
UI and in‑world print use mid‑century sans and condensed display types, hand‑lettered ads, and patronizing brochure copy (Vault‑Tec pamphlets). These lexical and typographic choices align the player’s visual field with mass‑market 1950s branding rather than contemporary interfaces; the effect is a continuous stylistic foregrounding of period advertising language (cf. common mid‑century lexemes appearing in broad English corpora) [1].

### Audio: soundtrack, jingles, and diegetic sound
Fallout layers licensed 1940s–50s crooners, upbeat radio jingles, and in‑world advertising spots (e.g., Nuka‑Cola ads) over scenes of decay. The juxtaposition of cheery crooner vocals with scorched urban ruins is deployed repeatedly to produce tonal dissonance: pleasant timbre masks catastrophe, converting nostalgia into irony.

### Rhetorical devices and repetition
Three devices recur: (1) ironic juxtaposition — upbeat music/ads over devastation; (2) kitsch elevation — mass‑market ephemera (matchbooks, cereal boxes) becomes collectible relic; (3) diegetic advertising — in‑world commercials, signage, and menus deliver satire from inside the fictional economy (a labyrinthine web of promotional materials that direct player attention inward). The design’s procedural and self‑referential quality evokes hypertextual “labyrinth” structures—advertising and UI links that loop back into worldbuilding—analogous to hypertextic recursion: “Planetary implosion in $seconds seconds” [3].

### Interpretive tensions
Scholars debate whether this aesthetic is nostalgic homage or critical parody; the persistent, smiling branding can be read both as critique of Cold War consumer optimism and as commodified nostalgia that simplifies critique into pastiche. Empirical inventory (timestamped screenshots of in‑world ads, radio logs, Pip‑Boy UI) is needed to disambiguate intentional satire from aesthetic appropriation.
