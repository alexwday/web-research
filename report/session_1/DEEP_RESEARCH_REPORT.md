## Executive Summary

The single most important finding is that deep‑sea mining offers large-scale deposits of battery and critical metals—quantities that could meaningfully supplement terrestrial supply—but when credible environmental costs and realistic regulatory scenarios are included, commercially attractive outcomes and lasting socio‑economic benefits are far from assured. Identified resource scales are substantial: a conservative estimate of 21.1 billion dry tons of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion‑Clipperton Zone and roughly 7.5 billion dry tons of cobalt‑rich crusts in the Pacific “Prime Crust Zone.” Technical pathways (near‑bottom collectors, riser systems, ROV/AUV mapping) and industry cost narratives support potential high revenues—an illustrative 2030 single‑company case projects annual revenue ≈ USD 4,379M with OpEx ≈ USD 2,721M (EBIT ≈ 38%). However, applying plausible ecosystem‑service liabilities flips that arithmetic: unit restoration costs of roughly USD 5.3–5.7M per km2 would turn the same 1,000 km2 example into an aggregate restoration bill (~USD 5,299M) and an EBIT ≈ −83%.

Ecologically, impacts are persistent and spatially amplified. Mining destroys benthic habitat directly, creates near‑bottom and surface sediment plumes that carry impacts beyond mined footprints, and perturbs water‑column chemistry. Because polymetallic nodules accrete only millimetres to centimetres per million years, habitat loss is effectively permanent on human policy horizons, and wholesale “restoration” at commercial scale is—by current technical and cost evidence—largely infeasible. Observed and modelled impact timescales range from decades (SMS fields) to centuries or longer (nodule provinces), with attendant losses in carbon burial services, fisheries productivity, and non‑use cultural values.

Economic and employment projections must therefore be scenario‑based and transparent about sensitivities. High‑deployment scenarios align with large upstream and midstream capital needs (the Future Minerals Forum cites an estimated US$5.4 trillion for mining and refining infrastructure by 2035), potentially generating onshore and offshore skilled and unskilled jobs if downstream processing is pursued. More precautionary, regionally constrained models that internalize environmental compensation (as in SPC/Cardno Pacific case studies) show much lower net benefits for host communities. Employment outcomes depend most on commodity prices, CAPEX/OPEX trajectories, learning rates, and fiscal regimes; analogues from terrestrial mining (Canada: +1% annual employment, +5% annual CAPEX growth) and observed labour trends (Indigenous employment growth ~+7%; rising environmental protection costs ~+10% annually) provide useful priors.

Governance choices matter: the ISA’s evolving regulatory framework (43 draft regulations and four annexes) and national moratoria create divergent pathways—moratorium, tightly regulated pilots, or full commercialization—each with distinct trade‑offs. The full report first situates resources, technologies, markets and governance; then presents scenario‑based economic and employment modelling; and concludes with detailed assessment of environmental risks, ecosystem valuation and policy trade‑offs to inform evidence‑based public and policy deliberation.

## Context: resources, technologies, market drivers and governance

### Deposit types and target elements
Deep‑sea mineral deposits fall into three principal classes with distinct element portfolios and mining challenges. Polymetallic nodules — “essentially two‑dimensional mineral deposits sitting on abyssal plain sediments” — are rich in manganese (Mn) and supply battery/base metals such as nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co) and molybdenum (Mo) [2]. Cobalt‑rich ferromanganese crusts (CRFCs) form pavements on seamounts and ridges and carry Co, Mn, Ni, Mo, tellurium (Te), platinum (Pt), vanadium (V) and a suite of rare‑earth elements (REEs, including lanthanides) [2]. Seafloor massive sulfides (SMS/PMS) concentrate Cu, Zn, Pb, Au and Ag and have been the focus of metallurgical testing in Russian Atlantic fields such as Logachev and MIR [3][1].

### Geographic hotspots and resource scale
The largest identified fields are spatially extensive. A conservative estimate places 21.1 billion dry tons of polymetallic nodules within the Clarion‑Clipperton Zone (CCZ) [2], while the Pacific “Prime Crust Zone” is estimated to contain roughly 7.5 billion dry tons of cobalt‑rich crusts [2]. Polymetallic nodules are typically found on abyssal plains at ~3,500–6,000 m depth, whereas cobalt‑rich crusts occur on seamounts and ridges across ~400–7,000 m depth ranges [2]. Regional sampling coverage is uneven but substantial in some provinces: the Yubko & Kazmin database compiled ~2,217 sampling stations across 20 ore provinces and 64 regions for cobalt‑bearing crusts and underpins many ore‑province statistics used in regulatory assessments [3].

### Technologies and common commercial claims
Technical approaches under discussion include near‑bottom collectors for nodules, riser and pumping systems to transport material to surface facilities, and remote‑operated or autonomous vehicles (ROV/AUV) for mapping, reconnaissance and precision extraction. Industry presentations and case studies (for example, Nautilus) have argued that certain seafloor projects “compare favourably to the land‑based operation” in grade and annual production metrics [3]. Commercial narratives frequently cite compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for demand in critical metals and project-level capital and operating cost ranges (CAPEX/OPEX) to support investment cases; explicit numerical assumptions vary between proponents and are presented within individual feasibility studies rather than as standardized public datasets [3][2].

### Governance, regulation and competing perspectives
The International Seabed Authority (ISA), operating under UNCLOS, is the central institution for governance of mineral activities in the Area. ISA workshop outputs stress both a regulatory framework in development and an environmental protection mandate: workshop documents framed their purpose “to examine the prospects for the development of cobalt‑rich ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides deposits in the Area” and to provide up‑to‑date technical and environmental information to members [3]. ISA draft regulations for prospecting/exploration run to 43 regulations plus four annexes, reflecting the breadth of governance issues being addressed [3]. At the same time, national-level moratoria and precautionary positions have emerged in some jurisdictions (see regulatory discussion in adjacent section on economic modelling and employment projections).

### Data provenance, competing claims and uncertainties
Two broad narratives recur in the literature. Optimistic resource‑potential statements — for example, the USGS projection that “about 35–45 per cent of the demand for critical metals will come from deep‑ocean mines by 2065” under an oil‑industry‑style development trajectory — point to major future supply potential if commercial rollout proceeds [2]. Countervailing voices in ISA proceedings emphasize the Authority’s protective mandate and the need for comprehensive environmental baseline data and standardization of metallurgical, grade and cost reporting before commercialization [1][3]. Industry case studies (e.g., Nautilus) and regional metallurgical tests (Logachev/MIR) provide promising technical datapoints, but methodologies and sampling densities differ across studies, and regulators explicitly call for comparative lifecycle and environmental‑cost analyses to contextualize claims about seafloor versus terrestrial mining impacts [1][3].

## Economic modelling and employment projections: scenarios, methods and local impacts

### Scenario envelopes and core modelling choices
Economic projections for deep‑sea mining (DSM) should be built around contrasting scenario envelopes: a high‑deployment, high‑investment pathway that assumes rapid commodity‑price recovery and large downstream scaling; and a precautionary, regionally constrained pathway that internalises high environmental and social costs. The high‑deployment envelope aligns with macro capital demand estimates—“an estimated US$5.4 trillion required by 2035” for mining, refining and supporting infrastructure cited by the Future Minerals Forum (CRU, 2024)—and implies high CAPEX/OPEX and accelerated deployment of midstream/refining capacity [5]. The precautionary envelope follows the SPC/Cardno Pacific CBA logic, which models monetised environmental and distributional effects for small island states and explicitly phases CAPEX/OPEX while modelling direct/indirect/induced impacts across communities (PNG, Cook Islands, RMI case studies) [4].

#### Key parameters and sensitivity levers
Models should explicitly vary: commodity‑price trajectories for battery metals and rare earths; phased CAPEX schedules and OPEX profiles (including ports, logistics, onshore processing); technology learning‑curve parameters (cost reduction rates per cumulative production); and regulatory regimes (full commercial opening, tightly regulated pilots, or moratoria). Sensitivity analysis should report ranges driven by (a) ± commodity‑price shocks, (b) CAPEX overruns or cost declines via learning rates, and (c) different fiscal regimes (tax/royalty rates, revenue‑sharing). Commercial providers named by FMF (CRU, Wood Mackenzie, Clareo‑DPI) are appropriate sources for empirical price and CAPEX scenarios, while the SPC/Cardno 2016 CBA provides regionally disaggregated expenditure phasing and multiplier structures for Pacific case studies [5][1].

### Employment modelling: methods and breakdowns
Employment estimates must disaggregate: offshore vs onshore jobs; skilled (engineers, ROV pilots, metallurgists) vs unskilled (vessel crew, plant operators); and supply‑chain roles (ports, shipping, downstream processing, construction). Use direct/indirect/induced multiplier frameworks (as in SPC/Cardno) to convert project expenditure into local employment across phases (exploration, construction/CAPEX, steady‑state OPEX, decommissioning) [4]. Labour‑market analogues from high‑quality terrestrial data can inform baseline ranges: Canada’s Mining Sector Performance Report (2014–2023) documents an average annual employment increase of +1% and capital expenditures growth of +5% (2014–2023), which can serve as conservative analogue trajectories for DSM under comparable jurisdictional performance [6]. Notable labour trends to parameterise include Indigenous employment growth (+7% average annual in Canada) and rising environmental protection expenditures (+10% average annual), which affect OPEX and workforce skill needs [6].

### Regional case studies and local impacts
Regional modelling should follow the SPC/Cardno architecture: project‑level CAPEX/OPEX breakdowns (including engineering, ports, logistics), government revenue treatment, and distributional flow tables for host communities (direct wages, local procurement, and fiscal transfers) [4]. Scenarios must capture the policy trade‑offs FMF highlights—whether host nations pursue downstream value‑add (“Rather than only exporting raw materials, these nations aim to produce higher value‑add midstream or downstream products”)—since onshore processing materially increases local employment multipliers and CAPEX requirements [5].

### Data needs and reporting conventions
Transparent public projections should publish: CAPEX/OPEX ranges by project type (nodules, SMS, crusts), phased expenditure schedules, commodity‑price scenarios, learning‑rate assumptions, employment multipliers, wage bands, and tax/royalty regimes. Present results as accessible ranges (low/central/high) with sensitivity tornadoes showing which inputs (price vs CAPEX vs regulation) dominate job and GDP outcomes, and link projections to the environmental accounting explored in the next section to compare net societal outcomes [4][2][3].

## Environmental risks, ecosystem valuation and policy trade‑offs

### Physical and ecological impacts observed and their timescales
Disturbance syntheses and industry/independent assessments converge on three linked physical–ecological mechanisms: direct seabed destruction by collector systems, sediment plumes (near‑bottom and surface/tailings) that expand impact beyond the mined footprint, and altered water‑column chemistry/physics that affect pelagic organisms and biogeochemical fluxes [7][3]. Polymetallic nodules grow only millimetres–centimetres per million years at abyssal depths of ~4,000–6,500 m, so “biota in the areas directly mined at the seabed will be killed,” and nodule‑mined sediments “are likely to be inhospitable to recovery for decades to centuries” (SMS impacts also measured in decades) [7][3]. Sediment plumes are explicitly expected to spatially amplify loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions beyond the direct footprint [9].

### Translating impacts into ecosystem‑service values
Three service domains capture the principal losses: carbon sequestration/burial, fisheries productivity (food‑web and bentho‑pelagic linkages), and cultural/non‑use values tied to deep‑sea habitats. Carbon implications are driven by disturbance of long‑buried particulates and altered burial rates; fisheries value is affected via reductions in biodiversity and habitat complexity that underpin benthic prey for mid‑water predators; cultural values reflect both local coastal stakeholders and global public interest in unique deep‑sea ecosystems. Economically, industry models that omit environmental internalization show attractive returns (example adapted to a 2030 single‑company case: annual area mined 1,000 km2, revenue ≈ USD 4,379M, OpEx ≈ USD 2,721M; EBIT ≈ 38%) [8]. When credible restoration/investment to compensate damage is applied (Planet Tracker’s illustrative unit restoration cost ≈ USD 5.3–5.7M per km2; USD ≈5,299M for the 1,000 km2 example), margins reverse sharply (EBIT ≈ −83%), demonstrating how valuation of ecological services can transform economic outcomes [8].

### Mitigation, monitoring and restoration: technical limits
Proposed mitigations include spatial zoning/avoidance, collector design to reduce seabed contact, sediment‑capture measures, and strict discharge controls. Monitoring and adaptive management are emphasized, but technical limits are decisive: nodules regrow at mm–cm per million years, making structural habitat loss functionally permanent on human timescales; sediment plumes are difficult to contain and can affect water‑column organisms well beyond footprint; large‑scale “restoration” (for example, artificial nodule replacement) carries very high costs and is described by one assessment as “an illusion” at commercial scales [8]. These constraints mean mitigation can reduce but not eliminate large, long‑lived losses to biodiversity and ecosystem services [8][3].

### Policy pathways and trade‑offs
Three policy pathways present clear contrasts:
- Moratorium: aligns with precautionary recommendations from several policy actors; prevents irreversible loss while allowing independent science and social deliberation [9].
- Tightly regulated pilots: limited, transparent pilot operations with binding performance bonds, independent monitoring, spatial limits, and explicit internalization of restoration and compensation costs; suitable if pilots can demonstrate no unacceptable long‑term harm and robust benefit‑sharing with host/coastal communities (see economic modelling in the previous section).
- Full commercialization: maximizes metal supply (the CCZ is estimated to hold 5–10× terrestrial reserves) but risks large, potentially irreversible ecological costs and major distributional inequities if environmental costs are not fully internalized and benefits are poorly shared [7][2].

### Equity, benefit‑sharing and practical recommendations
The International Seabed Authority’s exploration footprint already exceeds 1,250,000 km2, implying governance and distributional choices will shape who gains and who bears losses [9]. Practical measures for decision‑makers include requiring that operators internalize realistic restoration/compensation deposits (scaled to USD millions per km2), enforce transparent benefit‑sharing with host/coastal communities, mandate independent baseline and BACI‑style monitoring, and limit commercial expansion until pilot performance meets strict ecological and socio‑economic benchmarks. These steps align environmental valuation with the scenario‑based economic modelling described in the preceding section and ensure policy choices reflect both the monetary and non‑monetary costs of deep‑sea mining [8][3].

## Conclusion

The evidence assembled across context, economic modelling and environmental assessment converges on a clear but uncomfortable conclusion: deep‑sea mining presents a credible pathway to supply critical metals at scale, with attendant prospects for substantial capital investment and localized employment, but those benefits are tightly bound to large, long‑lived ecological costs and profound uncertainties that will determine whether net social outcomes are positive or negative. Three overarching themes structure this synthesis. First, there is an intrinsic trade‑off between extractive opportunity and ecological permanence. Technologies and business models can deliver high grades and economically attractive project profiles under conventional accounting, yet once realistic valuations of lost ecosystem services—carbon burial, fisheries support, and intrinsic cultural values—are incorporated, the arithmetic that underpins profitability and job creation can reverse. Second, pervasive uncertainty and asymmetric data constrain credible forecasting. Differing deposit geologies, incomplete sampling, uncertain price trajectories, and opaque CAPEX/OPEX assumptions produce wide scenario envelopes; this uncertainty matters more than parameter fine‑tuning because it interacts non‑linearly with environmental risks (for example, plume dispersal and multi‑decadal habitat loss). Third, distributional and governance tensions are decisive. Whether benefits accrue locally through downstream processing and workforce development, or flow to distant capital centers, depends on policy choices—tax regimes, contractual terms, environmental liability frameworks and ISA rule‑making—that will shape investment incentives and social acceptance for decades.

The practical implications are immediate. Policymakers should avoid binary choices between rapid commercialization and blanket moratoria; instead, they must create decision architectures that require transparent, standardized disclosure of economic assumptions, enforceable financial assurance for long‑term ecological liabilities, and robust independent environmental baselines and monitoring tied to adaptive thresholds for operations. Host states should weigh employment strategies that prioritize downstream value‑adding where feasible, recognizing the higher CAPEX this demands and the need for parallel investments in skills and infrastructure. Investors and companies should internalize ecological liabilities in project valuations and account for the probability of tightening regulation and litigation risk. Finally, international governance—principally the ISA—will determine path dependence; rule design must reconcile precaution with well‑scoped, tightly monitored pilot operations if pilots are to be informative rather than permissive.

To reduce policy‑relevant uncertainty and improve decision quality, future research should pursue targeted, operationally specific work. First, develop open, spatially explicit coupled economic–ecological models that integrate plume dispersion, benthic recovery trajectories, carbon burial impacts, fisheries linkages, and scenario families for commodity prices, learning curves and fiscal regimes; these models should be modular, publish assumptions, and enable sensitivity decomposition. Second, fund coordinated long‑term experimental disturbance studies across deposit types and depths that measure functional recovery (community composition, biogeochemical fluxes, and pelagic impacts) over decadal timescales using standardized protocols. Third, undertake high‑resolution socioeconomic supply‑chain analyses for exemplar jurisdictions that simulate alternative development paths (export raw nodules, partial processing, full onshore refining) to quantify employment multipliers, skills requirements, fiscal outcomes and distributional impacts for indigenous and coastal communities. Fourth, prioritize engineering research on mitigation technologies—plume suppression, low‑contact collectors, and realistic containment systems—paired with independent cost‑benefit assessments that include lifecycle environmental liabilities. Finally, conduct legal‑institutional research to design and test fiscal instruments (performance bonds, environmental insurance, benefit‑sharing clauses) and adaptive governance criteria that could be piloted under ISA oversight. Together, these focused efforts will convert the current wide scenario envelopes into usable knowledge for balanced, evidentiary policymaking.
